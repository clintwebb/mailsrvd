Mail server daemon that accepts incoming emails (it is an MTA), sends outgoing emails, and serves POP3.  Uses an MySQL database to store most configuration, and all email data.  Handles multiple domains easily and good for virtual hosting.

**Development on this project is slow.  It does what the original author needed it to do, and hasn't got much further than that.**

**It currently does not send emails out, and POP3 support hasn't been tested very well (it works for us)**

**Installation is not very well automated because we were the only ones using it, and we hadn't had to install it anywhere else**

If you want more development done on this, we'll see what we can do.
