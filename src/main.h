//  This project is intended to be a simple, robust mail server.  It was 
//  developed because of a lack of easy to use mail server software out there.  
//  Most existing software was either too complicated, or two difficult to 
//  configure.  This software uses very simple method for domain addresses, and 
//  mailboxes within addresses.   It is incredibly easy to configure it to 
//  handle multiple mailboxes on multiple domains.
//
//  Additionally some extra functionality has been added.   An extention to the 
//  SMTP protocol that allows emails to be picked up from the sending mail 
//  server by using DNS lookup, rather than receiving email from anyone who 
//  tries to send one.   It is not a measure to reduce spam, however it is a 
//  measure to give a bit more control to the receiving mailserver over when it 
//  will receive emails, and from whom.
